In this assignment you will practice writing code for Convolutional Neural Networks and Residual Networks. 

## Setup
Follow the same setup steps as the last project.

### Download data:
Run the following from the `problem1` directory:

```bash
cd stats232a/datasets
./get_datasets.sh
```

### Start IPython:
After you have the CIFAR-10 data, you should start the IPython notebook server from the
`problem1` directory, with the `jupyter notebook` command. 

### To do:
Follow the instruction in CNNandResNet.ipynb.

### What to submit:
Zip problem1 folder. Do not include folders '.env' and './stats232a/datasets'.
